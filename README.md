# MiniWeb
A minimal web framework built off of node's ```request``` module

## To build and serve the website:
You need to have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your computer. 
```
git clone https://github.com/Benjamin-Dewey/miniweb.git
cd miniweb/src
node fansite

```
You don't need to ```npm install``` the dependencies in package.json since they are only for testing purposes.
